# Day 02 – Automating System Tasks with Python

## Task

Today’s goal is to use **Python to interact with APIs and work with JSON data**.

You will create a Python script that:
- Calls a **public API** (example: GitHub API, JSONPlaceholder) [list](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
- Fetches data using the `requests` library
- Parses the JSON response
- Extracts meaningful information from the response
- Prints the processed output to the **terminal**
- Saves the processed data into a **JSON file**

This task helps you understand how DevOps engineers work with APIs and structured data.


## Expected Output

- One Python script (example: `api_data_fetcher.py`)
- One JSON output file (example: `output.json`)
- Output should be visible:
  - In terminal
  - In the JSON file


## Guidelines

- Use:
  - `requests` library to call APIs
  - `.json()` to parse API responses
  - Dictionaries and lists to extract data
  - Functions to keep the code clean
- API can be:
  - GitHub public API  
  - JSONPlaceholder API  
- Keep the script simple and readable
- CLI arguments are optional (bonus)

## Why This Matters for DevOps

Modern DevOps work is **API-driven**:
- Cloud platforms
- Kubernetes
- Monitoring tools
- CI/CD systems

Understanding how to call APIs and parse JSON responses is a **core DevOps skill**.
