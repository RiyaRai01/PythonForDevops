# Day 01 – Python for DevOps 🚀

## System Health Monitoring Script

This project is part of my DevOps learning journey.
The goal is to build a simple Python script to monitor system health.

## Features
- Takes CPU, Memory, and Disk thresholds from user input
- Fetches real-time system metrics using psutil
- Compares metrics with thresholds
- Displays system health status in terminal

## Technologies Used
- Python
- psutil library

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install psutil
2. Run the script:
   python system_health.py

## Why This Matters
DevOps engineers automate health checks, monitoring, and validations.
This script builds a strong foundation for automation and monitoring.
